## 0.3.0

### ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
There are a lot of breaking changes from 0.2.x to 0.3.x. I am sorry about that, but this is a fundamental rewrite! And it's so much better. This should be the last 0.x release. Provided nothing major comes up, we'll move on to 1.0.0 pretty quickly.

### Changed
- Changed the package name from `aaronfrancis/solo` to `soloterm/solo`. I've marked `aaronfrancis/solo` abandoned on Packagist.
- Changed the namespace from `AaronFrancis\Solo` to `SoloTerm\Solo`
- Completely rewrote the rendering pipeline
- Changed how hotkeys work. They are now configurable.

### Added
- Interactive commands!
- A new quick nav popup
- Hotkeys per command
- A new solo:dumps command that you can use to intercept `dump` calls in your application.
- A new solo:make command that lets you quickly access all Laravel make:* commands
- An enhanced tail command that collapses vendor frames and lets you truncate the logs via hotkey

### Removed
- Removed the need for you to have a service provider in favor of a much simpler config file. You'll need to migrate to the config file approach and delete your service provider.
- Removed all the `allowRegistrationFrom` hoops you had to jump through to register commands. This means that any third-party package could register a command. Any malicious third-party package can _already_ run `shell_exec` without Solo. Running a malicious script via Solo just makes it totally obvious that it's happening. So the security that `allowRegistrationFrom` added was performative at best.
